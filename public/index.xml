      <description>Dear Diary,
I would say the door speaks about the decay of happiness and intimate connections with other people over period of time. As the women go through stages of life, there are moments of weakness where darkness loom over her- and she fallen into depression.
Honestly, the more I think about it- the more the poem thinks about depression- and the constant battle to overcome it.
Sometimes, even when you are happy- the depression kicks in and the door swings open and close really quickly-that the person suffering from it don&amp;rsquo;t even notice.</description>

      <description>Dear Diary,
Hands can be both gentle and violent..Today class is interesting..As the teach mentioned, the story does seem to move back and froth in time.
I can see home, family, trauma, and broken love as a theme. I don&amp;rsquo;t know, this is a very hard story to hear in class.
I don&amp;rsquo;t like how this story is also about &amp;ldquo;cultural norms&amp;rdquo; and a conflict towards change through each generation. That&amp;rsquo;s bullshit, regardless of culture people should not be beating people.</description>

      <description>Dear Diary,
Powder is about the lack of relationship between a father and son. The father is irresponsible, unreliable, and tries to be adventurous. The son, as a result is placed in an adult role when he’s around his father.
I would say my relationship with my mother is similar to powder. Similarly, my mom took me out to a nightclub, and my father disapprove. Like the father, my mother is moody, and unstable.</description>

      <description>Dear Diary,
Isn’t it interesting that people are considered to become “adults” when they stop believing in Santa Clause? At what point I wonder, did our society associate maturity as someone who stop have faith, imagination, and belief in something magical? Why does “growing up” mean being cynical and jaded? Why can’t people believe in Santa Clause and be considered emotionally mature?
Or let’s reframe this question: there are people who believe in aliens, ghosts, zodiac signs, the supernatural, god and conspiracy theories- and those are seen as acceptable beliefs to possess.</description>
