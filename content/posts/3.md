Dear Diary,

Powder is about the lack of relationship between a father and son. The father is irresponsible, unreliable, and tries to be adventurous. The son, as a result is placed in an adult role when he’s around his father.

I would say my relationship with my mother is similar to powder. Similarly, my mom took me out to a nightclub, and my father disapprove. Like the father, my mother is moody, and unstable. She can go from being extremely nice to terrifying at the drop of a hat. 

Today class made me think about my relationship with my parents- or the lack of it. Would understanding them help repair my relationship with them? Do I even want to? I haven’t talked to my father in a year, and I don’t think he cares enough to try to repair our relationship with each other. I don’t even want to try because I feel like it’s the parents job to reach out or try.  And to be honest, I don’t even what him to try. I don’t even enjoy spending time with my father, so why should I even send him a text? 

To be honest, the kid is lucky that his father is even trying to impress him.  It’s very common for divorced parents to try to earn their kids affection, and fight over who is the “better” or more “likeable” parents. Mine simply doesn’t care. I kinda wish my story is similar to powder and maybe have a new beginning with my family. IDK, today class is kinda miserable.
