Dear diary,

Anyhow, I'm glad I didn't skip the class because it cleared things up. I thought the misfit was her own son that she disowned or left in the orphanage, but it turns out that it's a religious expression. He's not her actual son, she's seeing him as her own children-and she's like everyone.

Can someone be more morally superior than others? I would think so, because I have no morals. Most people want reality to be true of their beliefs. I want my beliefs to be true to reality. As such, I would constantly change my beliefs and philosophy depending on newfound information or if anyone can provide me with a logical argument on why I'm wrong. 

The grandma seem to pass judgement on others- with the notion that she have conscience that's guiding her. She's always right, and everyone don't know what they are doing Ironically, she's a hypocrite..but I would say she have morals, even if she doesn't always oblige to them..Yes, she was dishonest- but so is everyone from time to time. 

Actually, I do have morals. Misfit have morals. When people say "you don't have any morals", they mean that the code of conduct by which you make choices & live isn't something I personally deem acceptable" 

Anyhow, at least the misfit is consistent in his principles because grandma isn't.
