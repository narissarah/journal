Dear Diary,

The teacher talked about the reflective journal. I don't know how to journal...I do recall trying to write a diary when I was younger, but couldn't follow through because I don't see the point of writing about my day. 

Why would I write about something that I already experience? I would write about new ideas or different interpretation of something; so I might as follow that structure for this project. Also, I get distracted really easily..I should check to see whether I have ADHD. 

Anyhow, I can't believe we are covering Iambic pentameter. What do they teach in Montreal? We covered this in grade 10 in Vancouver.
