There's a difference between looking and being, just like there's a difference between hearing and listening. 

Although the narrator have eyesight, he's blind. It makes me wonder what I'm blinded by? Or what my friends are blinded by. 

 Miranda is a pretty self-aware person, but I don't think she realized how she have no boundaries what so ever. She's unable to set boundaries for herself. She doesn't know how to directly tell people "no", and it's not typical for someone with a Mexican heritage. Mexicans are generally pretty confrontational..and she usually just ignore and let people walk over her.
 
 She tells me earlier today that it's that our friendship is really healthy and balanced. I don't even have the heart to tell her that friendship isn't simply just the other person talking about themselves...and her listening and providing them with validation. I did offer her that she can talk to me about anything.
 
 Anyhow, I find it sad the main character think of himself superior because he can see. How insecure can someone be that they think themselves better than the other person simply having eyesight?
 
 Okay, to be fair-the teacher maid a valid point. He is insecure. He doesn't respect his wife, and he keeps on hinting of the other guys that she been "with". 
 
 Why is she even with him? Not only does he slut-shame her, but the guy seems rather boring actually.
