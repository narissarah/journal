Dear Diary,

I find it interesting that people keep on referring to Andres as "arrogant". From my perspective, he's a cynical guy who is in a life-threatening situation.

Yes, so he seem to "have no fear" as the girl who was in front of me put it, but to be honest-that's a front. Some people coping mechanism is to laugh, and make light of a situation. So although he is making jokes, and testing the waters- that's him trying to reassure himself that everything is fine. I know a few people who would be ridiculing the robbers, as opposed to following "orders". 

Also a bank with a wall art of Zeus and europa seems pretty cool. 

Anyhow in class today we talked about what your last memory would be. I tell everyone that I would be trying to remember anything that would help me survive. Anything I learn from movies, or books-on how best to prolong my life. I don't want to die. 

I asked my friends later what they think their last memory would be- and they seem to think they would remember the happy, and simple time.  

Why do people think their last memory would be a happy one? More often not, I would imagine people last memory would be of regrets, guilt, and something terrible that they repressed that eventually come bubbling out.
