Dear Diary,

I have the song "horse with no name" stuck in my head all day. I reread the chapter and I realized I missed a couple of details- namely that Indian warriors do not name their horses. It's a human thing to try to to put a name or face.

Speaking of name Coke High seems like a horrible name for a horse. Through I don't know if I would want a pet, it a pretty big commitment. 

I didn't attend class today, and the story is pretty boring. It tails about a truck.

Oh, one think that sticks to me is that newer car models "have no heart" and that's why he stuck with his truck. I don't know what that means.
