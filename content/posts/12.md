Dear Diary,

The death of the moth is a very ironic title for the story. The moth spent most of it's time trying to live-and eventually dies at the end.  

I say, it's a story about life-more than death. However, it can also eludes to the human life as a whole.

We all try our best to stay alive (well, most people)..Eventually it's meangless because we all die eventually.

I don't remember where I read it from, but I heard a saying that "we are all equal in the presence of death", I think that's true. No matter what creature, or the stars, or what we accomplished in life- we are defenceless against death.

It's a bleak way to view life..we all die, alone. 

The speaker is fascinate by the moth will to live, is this a hint that the narrator suffers from depression and is contemplating the drive to live-even if it's futile.
