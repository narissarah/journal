Communication is the main theme of the story. Or more precisely, the lack of it. 

No one is communicating, not even Mr.Kapasi- and he works an an interpreter! He's not talking to his wife, and continues to buy luxuries for his wife to avoid talking about their son death. They need to go to therapy and discuss how their son death affects them..or they really need to talk to each other. 

I think it would be really cool to be a translator! 

Mr.Das is unaware of his wife cheating, and as I pointed out earlier in class-the father is so blinded by reality and his camera that he sees a man needing help, and decide to take a picture of it as a souvenir...

Zac pointed out the monkey. I feel like we spend the entire time talking about Bobby today?..A child born out of a secret affair, who sees the most out of everyone.

But I think we should have discuss the whole infidelity thing more in class..

Oh, it also occurred to me that a photograph can also symbolize how they appear to be "picture perfect" family. Since Mr.Das  was getting his family to be in pictures that suggest harmony and intimacy.

>Kinda like social media...There's a company that sells digital clothes now. Anyhow, yea, everyone is nowadays seeing a fabrication of someone else life that doesn't reflect reality.
