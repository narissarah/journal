Dear Diary,

I admit I'm ashamed..I wasted the entire day just looking at lobsters, crabs, oysters and seafood. They look amazing.

Then I keep on going back and froth in the article, and it never occurred to me that they boil the lobster alive before. Then I went back and look at those delicious lobsters, and look at seafood restaurants...

I can't imagine being boiled alive- it's inhumane. I'm looking up seafood restaurants nearby ...I wonder it's possible to ask them to kill the lobster quickly before boiling them alive? Seriously, there's no need to slowly kill a creature to death. It's unnesscary torture.

Not only lobsters, but it turns out crab also have nervous system and can feel pain. Seriously?!

Then I looked up the reason why lobsters are boiled alive, and it make sense actually. Lobsters and crabs have harmful bacteria that multiply rapidly, so people cooked them to decrease the chance of food poisoning.

Logically it makes sense. Ethically, it's inhumane. But what is more inhumane, torturing someone by giving someone food poisoning or boiling a creature alive? Actually, still boiling a living creature alive for the sake of it being a bit  "fresher" is still inhumane..

Through the lobster pictures looks really delicious.
