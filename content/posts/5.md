Dear Diary,

Hands can be both gentle and violent..Today class is interesting..As the teach mentioned, the story does seem to move back and froth in time.

I can see home, family, trauma, and broken love as a theme. I don't know, this is a very hard story to hear in class. 

I don't like how this story is also about "cultural norms" and a conflict towards change through each generation. That's bullshit, regardless of culture people should not be beating people. 

But yeah, it tough because a child- you are raised to love a parents, and they talk about how you should "love" and "respect" them; and you can't help but love them unconditionally..but eventually you realize that their behaviour isn't a norm. And how it's very easy for people to dismiss immigrants as their culture. 

At least the daughter realized that the love for father will eventually fade over time.
